title: Managing Redux Side Effects with Async Await
headline: Sagas are great. However, they come with an extensive and somewhat complicated api and they require functional knowledge of generators. Here I revist my react-boilerplate repo refactored with async/await side effect management.

The [effects branch](https://github.com/deldreth/react-boilerplate/tree/effects)
contains the changes detailed in this post.

### The Basics
With redux-saga we're ultimately using a promise like approach for side effect
management. It comes with a series of functions that describe to the saga
middleware the expectation of the yields.

With the async/await approach we avoid the complications of using generators
and rely soley on ES2017 async modifiers. The project now has a dependency
of [redux-effex](https://github.com/exponent/redux-effex) which provides some utilities for setting up the async
functions (nothing quite as complicated as sagas).


### Our First Async Side Effect

The most basic side effect of the boilerplate app is expecting the app to
load. Previously with redux sagas that generator looked like this:

```javascript
export function * watchAppLoaded () {
  while (true) {
    yield take(Types.LOADED);

    yield put(Actions.fetchPosts());
  }
}
```

We eventually `fork` the saga as part of the export.

With redux-effex and async functions we can rework this side effect as:

```javascript
import type { EffectParams } from 'redux-effex';

async function loadedAync ( { action, dispatch, getState }: EffectParams ) {
  dispatch( Actions.fetchPosts() );
}

export default [
  {
    action: Types.LOADED,
    effect: loadedAync,
    error: errorHandler
  }
];
```

We've defined an async function `loadedAsync` that performs the same dispatch
as the saga. Note the added destructing syntax of the function signature.

I'm not going to go into detail about the export syntax for redux-effex. It's
documented well enough.


### Awaiting for Async Responses

With redux-saga we have to _yield_ to the call saga method for our API calls.
With redux-effex we can simply define an expression as await. The previous
example dispatched the FETCH_POSTS action. Here is the async function for handling
the side effects.

```javascript
async function fetchPostsAsync ( { actions, dispatch, getState }: EffectParams ) {
  const response = await Api.getPosts();

  if ( response.ok ) {
    dispatch( Actions.receivePosts( response.data ) );
  } else {
    // Some error
  }
}

export default [
  {
    action: Types.FETCH_POSTS,
    effect: fetchPostsAsync,
    error: errorHandler
  }
];
```


### Summary

We don't have to enforce our intimate knowledge of generators in situations
where we want to manage redux side effects. Relying on ES2017 async/await is
a simple enough alternative.
