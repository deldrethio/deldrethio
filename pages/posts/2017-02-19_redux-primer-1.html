I've been working with React and subsequently Redux for nearly two years. On
occassion I still hear people expressing confusion over Redux. The goal of
this tutorial is to provide a basic but comprehensive series of explainations
for all things Redux. Several of the sections will also provide coding tasks
and examples that can be worked on independently.

Redux isn't out to get you. Sit back. Deep breath. Here we go.

# History: Flux and Redux <a name="history"></a>
To get where you're going it's important to know where you've been. Enter
Flux. React at a very high level has always been a library for writing user
interfaces. It never provided any strong data separation. Each component had
state and various things modified that state. Communication between components
largely boiled down to passing props down to children. Flux provides a
unidirectional data flow: actions sent through a dispatcher which routed to
a store and a change event would eventually be fired so components could
rerender. Flux showed that React applications could have a separation of
concerns. The store could reduce state and the view layer needed only rerender
from the current state.

**The basis of this data flow remain in Redux.**

Redux took the ideas behind Flux and wrapped them up in a more consumable way.
It removed the need to architect a system of a concept specific to React and
allowed developers to focus on maintaining state.

If you want to know more about the history and motivation behind redux then I
suggest checking out the [Prior Art](http://redux.js.org/docs/introduction/PriorArt.html)
of the Redux docs.

<!-- ### The Confusion of Flux
So often we find ourselves simply installing a new package to gain a new
piece of functionality that solves a problem. Flux wasn't something we could
just plug into an already running application. Using it required that the
application be architected around its concepts. I think this created a lot of
initial confusion surrounding flux.  -->

# Terms

**Action**: Strings that represent the name of an action. Usually defined as a
constant. I refer to these as types.
```javascript
const HAS_APPLES = 'HAS_APPLES';
```

**Action Creator**: Functions that return an object that describes an action.
I often refer to these as actions. Think of them as giving context to an
action that by itself has little meaning.
```javascript
const hasApples = ( number_of_apples ) => {
  return {
    type: HAS_APPLES,
    number_of_apples
  };
};
```

**Reducer**: Pure functions that accept two arugments: the previous state and
the return of an action creator (I will usually just refer to this as the
action). Reducers return the next or new state. They **DO NOT** modify the
state that they were given.
```javascript
const hasApplesReducer = ( state = PREVIOUS_STATE, action ) => {
  return {
    ...state,
    apples: action.number_of_apples
  };
};
```

**Store**: All things Redux pass through the store. It is an object that
provides the following:

1. Stores application state.
2. Allows access to state through `getState()`.
3. Allows state to be updated with `dispatch(action)`.
4. Registers listeners via `subscribe(listener)`.
6. Handles unregistering of listeners via the function returned by
   `subscribe(listener)`.

# The Three Principles

### 1. Single Source of Truth
This principle is actually quite simple: The entire state of your application
should be represented as a single object within a single store.

### 2. State is Immutable
Also conceptually straight forward. **State cannot be modified directly.**
The only way to modify state is by dispatching actions that describe the
changes that should happen to state.

### 3. State Updates are Made with Pure Functions
Pure functions. For a function to be pure the following statements must hold:

1. The function always evaluates the same result given the same arguments. The
  result cannot depend on any hidden information that could change during
  execution.
2. Evaluation of the result does not cause any side effects.

This means that our **reducers** will always be pure functions. They take
a previous state and an action and return the next or new state.

# Data Flow

Data flow in Redux is unidirectional. The attached diagram shows the flow of
data relative to a 'View' or some 'Side Effect'. All actions pass through the
store and the store provides state. Take
note that unlike Flux redux does not use the concept of a Dispatcher, but the
store does provide a dispatch function. This diagram abstracts this out as the
entry point of the store.

Redux allows for functions to be executed as middleware to extend the
functionality of the store. Remember principle 3: **state updates are made
with pure functions**. Middlwares give added functionality to actions moving
through the store. Middlewares also commonly create **side effects** named
because they are a side effect of the action that was dispatched. A middleware
could also just be a call to `console.log` to allow us inspection of the
action.

The **View** in this diagram is an abstract concept of the view layer. Since
we will be talking about Redux and its relationship to React the **View**
could be a `connect()` wrapped component and includes the expectation that
the **View** will be rendering and potentially dispatching its own actions.

_The same abstraction applies to **Side Effects**._
