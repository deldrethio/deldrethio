I've been working with React and subsequently Redux for nearly two years. On
occassion I still hear people expressing confusion over Redux. The goal of
this tutorial is to provide a basic but comprehensive series of explainations
for all things Redux. Several of the sections will also provide coding tasks
and examples that can be worked on independently.

Redux isn't out to get you. Sit back. Deep breath. Here we go.

# History: Flux and Redux <a name="history"></a>
To get where you're going it's important to know where you've been. Enter
Flux. React at a very high level has always been a library for writing user
interfaces. It never provided any strong data separation. Each component had
state and various things modified that state. Communication between components
largely boiled down to passing props down to children. Flux provides a
unidirectional data flow: actions sent through a dispatcher which routed to
a store and a change event would eventually be fired so components could
rerender. Flux showed that React applications could have a separation of
concerns. The store could reduce state and the view layer needed only rerender
from the current state.

**The basis of this data flow remain in Redux.**

Redux took the ideas behind Flux and wrapped them up in a more consumable way.
It removed the need to architect a system of a concept specific to React and
allowed developers to focus on maintaining state.

If you want to know more about the history and motivation behind redux then I
suggest checking out the [Prior Art](http://redux.js.org/docs/introduction/PriorArt.html)
of the Redux docs.

# Terms

**Action**: Strings that represent the name of an action. Usually defined as a
constant. I refer to these as types.
```javascript
const HAS_APPLES = 'HAS_APPLES';
```

**Action Creator**: Functions that return an object that describes an action.
I often refer to these as actions. Think of them as giving context to an
action that by itself has little meaning.
```javascript
const hasApples = ( number_of_apples ) => {
  return {
    type: HAS_APPLES,
    number_of_apples
  };
};
```

**Reducer**: Pure functions that accept two arugments: the previous state and
the return of an action creator. Reducers return the next or new state.
They **DO NOT** modify the state that they were given.
```javascript
const hasApplesReducer = ( state = PREVIOUS_STATE, action ) => {
  return {
    ...state,
    apples: action.number_of_apples
  };
};
```

**Store**: All things Redux pass through the store. It is an object that
provides the following:

1. Stores application state.
2. Allows access to state through `getState()`.
3. Allows state to be updated with `dispatch(action)`.
4. Registers listeners via `subscribe(listener)`.
6. Handles unregistering of listeners via the function returned by
   `subscribe(listener)`.

<a name="three"></a>
# The Three Principles

### 1. Single Source of Truth
This principle is actually quite simple: The entire state of your application
should be represented as a single object within a single store.

### 2. State is Immutable
Also conceptually straight forward. **State cannot be modified directly.**
The only way to modify state is by dispatching actions that describe the
changes that should happen to state.

### 3. State Updates are Made with Pure Functions
Pure functions. For a function to be pure the following statements must hold:

1. The function always evaluates the same result given the same arguments. The
  result cannot depend on any hidden information that could change during
  execution.
2. Evaluation of the result does not cause any side effects.

This means that our **reducers** will always be pure functions. They take
a previous state and an action and return the next or new state.

<a name="data-flow"></a>
# Data Flow

Data flow in Redux is unidirectional. The attached diagram shows the flow of
data relative to a 'View' or some 'Side Effect'. All actions pass through the
store and the store provides state. Take
note that unlike Flux Redux does not use the concept of a Dispatcher, but the
store does provide a dispatch function. This diagram abstracts this out as the
entry point of the store.

Redux allows for functions to be executed as middleware to extend the
functionality of the store. Remember principle 3: **state updates are made
with pure functions**. Middlwares give added functionality to actions moving
through the store. Middlewares also commonly create **side effects** named
because they are a side effect of the action that was dispatched. A middleware
could also just be a call to `console.log` to allow us inspection of the
action.

The **View** in this diagram is an abstract concept of the view layer. Since
we will be talking about Redux and its relationship to React the **View**
could be a `connect()` wrapped component and includes the expectation that
the **View** will be rendering and potentially dispatching its own actions.

_The same abstraction applies to **Side Effects**._

<a name="actions"></a>
# Action Types and Creators
I mentioned before that I prefer to refer to actions as types and action
creators simply as actions. This helps avoid some confusion over the
expectations of an action and an action creator.

### Types
Types are very straight forward. They're a value, usually a string, defined as
a constant. They're analogous to a event name. In organizing my react redux
applications I tend to prefer prefixing types with some label that indicates
their relationship with the rest of redux: `APP_`, `TRACK_`, etc.

These are valid types:
```javascript
const APP_START = 'APP_START';
const AUTH_SUCCESS = 'AUTH_SUCCESS';
```

### Creators
Action creators are functions that return an object that describes an action
type. By themselves types are not very discriptive and in order to use them
with Redux's dispatch they need to be part of an object. Creators let us
handle that expectation.

types.js
```javascript
export const AUTH_SUCCESS = 'AUTH_SUCCESS';
```

We now have a type called `AUTH_SUCCESS` but we don't know what it actually does.

creators.js
```javascript
import { AUTH_SUCCESS } from './types';

export const authSuccess = ( user: Object ) => ({
  type: AUTH_SUCCESS,
  user
});
```

From the `authSuccess( user )` creator we can tell that dispatches of action
`AUTH_SUCCESS` will expect a user object.

Action creators need not be any more complicated than this. They're simply
functions that describe the types they use. They only need to return an object
that has a **type** property.

<a name="store"></a>
# The Store
The Redux Store is the workhorse of redux. Everything that is Redux passes
through the store. In turn the store exposes the state and dispatch of Redux.
Stores can get pretty complicated as they're extended through middleware.
Often store creation is wrapped within a function. I will show both examples

This is the most basic of stores:
```javascript
import { createStore } from 'redux';
import reducer from '../reducers/';

export default createStore( reducer );
```

Here we've done nothing really exciting with our store. We provided redux's
`createStore()` with our reducer and exported the resulting store. Stores
don't need to by any more complicated than this. However, in setup for the
next section I'll show what a more robust store might look like.

```javascript
import { createStore, applyMiddleware, compose } from 'redux';
import reducer from '../reducers/';

export default (): Object => {
  const middleware = [];

  const enhancers = compose(
    applyMiddleware( ...middleware )
  );

  return createStore(
    reducer,
    enhancers
  );
};
```
We've now created a store with the expectation that it will have middleware
that **enhance** its functionality through compose. Compose is a useful
functional utility that takes a variable number of arguments that are
functions and like the [docs](http://redux.js.org/docs/api/compose.html)
say: **don't overthink it**.

Also, I prefer returning my store as a function. This isn't a requirement. You
also export an [IIFE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immediately-invoked_function_expression)
or the created object itself.

<a name="middleware"></a>
# Middleware
Our store is ready to party. Though, say we want to log actions as they move
through the store. The best way to do this is through the store's middleware.
Remember that state is immutable. Middleware must respect this princple.
However, they can expose all sorts of functionality to the store. Logging
is simple enough to outline the basis and if you've got any experience with
Express' middleware api then this should sit well with you.

The basic structure of a middleware:
```javascript
const middleware = store => next => action => {
  return next( action );
};
```

You can evaluate the store before and after calling next. Next applies the
action to the store but it does not modify the state.

```javascript
const middleware = store => next => action => {
  console.log( 'Previous State', store.getState() );
  let result = next( action );
  console.log( 'Next State', store.getState());

  return result.
};
```

<a name="immutability"></a>
# Immutability

I don't intend to go too deep into immutability since other parts of this
primer really attempt to enforce the idea that the state of Redux cannot be
changed except through reducers returning new state. I do, however, want to
provide a brief list of really useful immutability helpers.

Obviously [Object.assign()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/assign)
can be used in situations where you don't want to use extra packages. Keep in
mind that not all browsers support Object.assign. If you're using lodash then
the [_.assign()](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.4#assign) can be used as a
replacement.

Facebook documentation suggests using [immutability-helper](https://github.com/kolodny/immutability-helper)
instead of the now deprecated react addons. I have actually been using this
helper in my production apps. Though I have very little use case for its other
functions outside of `$merge`.

I've also used [seamless-immutable](https://github.com/rtfeldman/seamless-immutable)
in some React Native applications.

<a name="reducers"></a>
# Reducers

Principle 3 requires that pure functions be used to modify state. As discussed
above we avoid side effects by ensuring that our reducers are pure.
If reducers were impure it could become difficult to rely on the state tree
for consistency. Much like the difficulty of determing application behavior
in languages that use **globals**. Maintaining pure functions for reducers
does not mean that they must be simple functions.

A common pattern in creating reducers is to define the initial state of a
group of reducers.

```javascript
const INITIAL_STATE = {
  user: null
};
```

A reducer could easily look like the following. I've used `Object.assign` here
to maintain simplicity and avoid relying on any immutability helpers.

```javascript
const receiveUser = ( state = INITIAL_STATE, action ) => {
  return Object.assign( {}, state, {
    user: action.user
  } );
};
```

We could map this reducer to an `AUTH_SUCCESS` action that contains a user
object.

```javascript
export default rootReducer = ( state = INITIAL_STATE, action ) => {
  switch( action.type ) {
      case AUTH_SUCCESS:
        return receiveUser( state, action );
      case default:
        return state;
  }
};
```

I've shown here how a reducer could be crafted to update an object with
the intended return of an action. However, what if we had an `UPDATE_FIRSTNAME`
action that only updated the user object's first name? Assuming that the
state's user property is no longer null we can clevery craft reducers with the
es6 object spread operator.

```javascript
const updateUsername = ( state = INITIAL_STATE, action ) => {
  return Object.assign( {}, state, {
    user: {
      ...state.user,
      first_name: action.first_name
    }
  } );
};
```

We also might need to mutate some API response that's given on an action to
better suit our application's expectations.

```javascript
const mapResponse = ( state = INITIAL_STATE, action ) => {
  return Object.assign( {}, state, {
    user: {
      fields: action.user.data.map( data => ( {
        name: data.name.replace(/\_/g, ' ').replace(/\w\S*/g, text =>
          text.charAt( 0 ).toUpperCase() + text.subStr( 1 ).toLowerCase() )
        } )
      } )
    }
  } );
};
```

Here we're kind of assuming that the names of fields could be human readable
and come in the form of `some_field_name`. Our user object will actually have
fields that are formatted like `name: 'Some Field Name'`.

Reducers can get fairly complicated. It's important to keep in mind that they
must not modify the state parameter they receive or cause side effects.

<a name="selectors"></a>
# Selectors

Another useful thing to do with Redux is to create functions that are referred
to as selectors. They allow us to **compute derived state** which is a complex
way to say that they allow us to make logic based off the entire state of the
app. Selectors are commonly used in the `mapStateToProps()` function, but they
are defined often defined alongside reducers.

Say that our user data contains an array of objects that contain meta data.
Some fields we want to display in the UI and others we don't. Their visibility
is returned as part of the field itself. We can create a reusable selector to
allow us to quickly pull out the visible fields.

Our state has been updated post auth such that the user property resembles
the following:
```javascript
const INITIAL_STATE = {
  user: {
    fields: [
        {
          name: 'Nickname',
          visible: true
        },
        {
          name: 'Signup Date',
          visible: false
        }
    ]
  }
};
```

Within our reducer file we export a named function to select only the visible
fields. Note that the state param will actually be the entire state of all
reducers so we must address the state accordingly. I've also added some
validation (this could also be done in the View layer).

```javascript
export const select_visibleUserData = ( state ) => {
  if ( !state.auth.user.fields ) {
    return [];
  }

  return state.auth.user.fields.filter( field =>
    field.visible === true
  );
};
```

This selector will always return an array relative to the auth user state.
Within a Redux connected React component we would use this selector in the
mapStateToProps function.

```javascript
import { select_visibleUserData } from '../reducers/authReducer';

const mapStateToProps = ( state ) => {
  fields: select_visibleUserData( state );
};
```

In this situation the fields prop will be an array that contains a single
object that contains the name _Nickname_. Selectors can be incredibly useful
and they help to maintain separation of concerns. Leaving the View layer
to worry about rendering the data instead of whether something should be
rendered.

<a name="side-effects"></a>
# Side Effects

When we dispatch actions we have the expectation that something immediate will
happen. The state will be updated in some way and the View layer will re-render
the changes. Nothing is always that simple. Sometimes our actions might cause
other things to happen within the application. These could be making requests
to an API or sequencing a series of dispatched actions. Whatever these might
be we refer to them as **side effects**, and they happen asynchronous through
middleware.

I won't go into any code examples for side effect management, and instead will
provide links to several useful libraries that can assist greatly with side
effects. All of these operate as middleware and require an understanding of
their API. Some are more complex than others.

[Redux Thunk](https://github.com/gaearon/redux-thunk) is arguably the most
popular of these libraries. It allows for the creation of [thunks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thunk)
relative to dispatched actions.

[Redux Saga](https://github.com/redux-saga/redux-saga) is probably my personal
favorite, but I hold a soft spot in my heart for generators. The API for sagas
can get complicated quick but it allows you to write complex synchronous
handlers for dispatched actions.

[Redux Effex](https://github.com/exponent/redux-effex) allows you to easily
use async/await functions so the API is expected standard javascript.
